## Overview

In this Tier 1 project, you will create a web based tamagotchi inspired virtual pet. You will create a friendly pet blob with a design of your choosing, a stats panel health/hunger/happiness, and a set of interaction buttons feed/clean/play.
As you build up your skills youâ€™ll be able to return to this project and add in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 features.
